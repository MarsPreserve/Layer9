## Layer9
Additional Layer 2 to the standard OSI model Layer 7 + 2

## What the project does
Adds two more layers of integrity to the OSI stack, extending beyond Layer 7 (Application) with blockchain‑based validation and decentralized certificate management. This ensures secure, verifiable transactions and transparent communication across distributed systems.

## Why the project is useful

Blockchain and Layer 2 solutions are increasingly requested for transaction integrity, scalability, and trust. Layer9 provides developers with a modular framework to integrate these features directly into protocol stacks, enabling:

-- 🔐 **Enhanced** security through decentralized certificate validation.
-- ⚡ **Scalability** with Layer 2 transaction handling.
-- 🧩 **Extensibility** for integrating cryptographic primitives and modular overlays.
